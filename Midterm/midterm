Question 1)

Design the classes and interfaces given below that will keep track of books borrowed in a library. Detail class specifications (data members, methods and access modifiers) are described below. Please note the following requirements:

Class Book:

This abstract class should have the following three private data members.

 

Fields: String title, double price, String publishYear

Book (String title, double price, String publishYear); //Constructor

Following are the public methods that this class should provide:

Methods: getter and setters

Add an abstract method to this class called description that will return a string.

Interface iBorrowable:

void setBorrowDate(int day)
void setReturnDate(int day)
boolean isAvailable(int day)

In order to implement the iBorrowable interface define new data members to store the borrow and return dates,
implement the setBorrowDate and setReturnDate methods to store values for these data members. Also implement the
isAvailable method to return false if the given data is between or equal to the start and end dates, otherwise it returns true.

Class Fiction:

This class should extends book class and implement the interface.

 

Fiction (String title, double price, String publishYear); //Constructor

Also implement the abstract method in parent class.

Sample description : “Frankenstein(title) all events are imaginary and not based on real facts”

Class NonFiction:

This class should extends book class and implement the interface.

 

NonFiction (String title, double price, String publishYear); //Constructor

 

Also implement the abstract method in parent class.

 

Sample description : “Anne Frank(title) all events are true and based on real facts.”

Class Reference:

This class should extends book class.

 

Fields: String category (example: dictionaries, encyclopedia)

Reference (String title, double price, String publishYear, String category); //Constructor

Method: getter and setter

Also implement the abstract method in parent class.

Sample description : “World Maps(title) all information is real.”

 

 

Question 2)

Implement singleton design for the code below

class Printer {

    private Printer() {     
   }
    public static Printer getInstance() {
   }
   class Main {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
          Printer p1;
      // refers to the only object of Database
          p1= Printer.getInstance();
     
          p1.getConnection();
      }
}

O/P : Your Printer is working

 

Question 3) For the given array, return the sum of all the numbers which are repeated.

Ex: Input : array = {1,3,-1,3,4,-1}

      Output : 3 + (-1) = 2

 

Question 4) Given a string s, find the longest substring without repeating characters.

Ex: Input: s = "abcabcbb"

      Output: abc

      Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

Consraints:

0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
